symbeline-realms is like Star Realms but with a DM deciding what goes in each
trade-row slot. the DM is auto-generated using LLM technology (Rimworld style)
it tells a story, and it provides the ships as guidance for it.

the story is output to the display and the context of each of the LLMs,
so they can all follow along with the story.

also, there's AI generated images of the ships doing battle with the stations
that is auto-generated while the turn is in play.

it's filled in little by little, to showcase-explain:

using programmatic inpainting, a canvas can slowly be developed, taking in
itself as input and the reference images of the picture cards in Star Realms.

oh, and it's fantasy themed, so we use cards that have sci-fi ships and then
we create fantasy scenarios from them.

we should also appreciably modify the game mechanics. here's some ideas:

  each time you buy a card, increment the d10. whenever it rolls over, you
  can draw an extra card this turn and each future turn. decrement it when 
  scrapping a card. underflows reduce the number of cards you draw by 1.
  track the number of extra cards you draw each turn with a d4. the d10
  starts at 5.

  the AI trade row management is significantly more likely to play multiples
  of cards that have already been drawn. To encourage unified, semi-singleton
  decks.

  cards that produce other cards that go into your discard pile. usually have
  either a "draw a card" effect or a "scrap this card and gain..." effect. if
  they don't, and they're permanent (unless scrapped) then they are 1 coin more
  powerful.

  think... a base that spawns infantry every turn. they show up to the next
  battle and draw a card, but are scrapped when played. they regroup back at
  the castle after the battle is over, so the scraps can recoavene.

  in fact most base-effects are like that. deploy an effect, but... next turn.
  
  also, when drawn at the start of a turn, their "draw effects" automatically
  materialize, and you just... draw those cards, and the effect "disappears
  from the card" until it's drawn again. In this way, the user won't have to
  play their draw-a-card effects, see what they drew, then play some more cards.
  they will just... auto-draw. before anything else happens.
