# Symbeline Realms - Faction Design Guide

## The Four Paths to Victory

Each faction in Symbeline Realms represents a different relationship with
tempo, deck quality, and the passage of time. Understanding these philosophies
is key to both playing and designing for the game.

| Faction | Strategy | Tempo | Core Mechanic |
|---------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Artificer Order | Invest now, compound forever | Steady | Scrap-Draw |
| Merchant Guilds | Build infrastructure, harvest steadily | Incremental | Kingdom Coin |
| High Kingdom | Optimize the cycle, win through consistency | Velocity | Recruit |
| The Wilds | Gather strength, strike once, strike hard | Burst | Frontier |

## Artificer Order: The Transmuters

**Philosophy:** Permanent transformation through sacrifice.

**Core Mechanic: Scrap-Draw**
When an Artificer card scraps from your hand, you immediately draw a
replacement. This makes deck-thinning card-neutral in the moment while
providing long-term deck quality improvement.

**Deck Economics:**
- Scrapping removes bad cards permanently
- Deck shrinks → higher density of good cards
- Faster shuffle velocity (fewer cards to cycle through)
- Each shuffle shows more power cards

**The Trade-off:**
Permanence. Once a card is scrapped, it's gone. You can't get it back.
This is powerful for removing starting Scouts and Vipers, but dangerous
if you scrap something you'll need later.

**Upgrade Specialists:**
Artificers can permanently upgrade your starting cards (Scouts and Vipers)
while they're in your hand:

| Card | Target | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| Blacksmith | Viper only | +2 Attack |
| Goldweaver | Scout only | +1 Trade (×2 per turn) |
| Enchanter | Scout or Viper | +2 Authority |

These upgrades persist across all future shuffles, creating compound value.

**The Scrap vs Upgrade Tension:**
You can't do both. A scrapped Scout is gone forever (velocity gain). An
upgraded Scout returns every shuffle with +1 Trade (compound value). The
Artificer player must choose: lean deck or enhanced deck?

**Cross-Faction Value:**
Everyone starts with Scouts and Vipers. Other factions can splash a
Blacksmith or Goldweaver to upgrade their starting cards without committing
to the full Artificer strategy.

**Play Pattern:**
Early game: Decide scrap vs upgrade for each starting card
Mid game: Scrap the rest, upgrade the keepers
Late game: Lean deck with enhanced Scouts/Vipers cycles rapidly

## Merchant Guilds: The Investors

**Philosophy:** Build infrastructure, then harvest the returns.

**Core Mechanic: Kingdom Coin**
A persistent currency that doesn't reset each turn. Generated by Merchant
infrastructure (Coin Mint, Exchange House, Guild Observatory), spent through
Merchant ally effects.

**The Coin Itself:**
Castle-stamped tungsten alloy. Too hot to de-mint, too common to covet—it
just... is. Used for inter-guild trade when regular currency won't do.

**Spending Tiers (Requires Merchant Ally):**
| Coin Cost | Reward | Source Card |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | +1 Combat | Guild Courier |
| 2 | Spawn Coin Guard | Guild Factor |
| 3 | Spawn Coin Scout | Gold Mage |
| 5 | Spawn Coin Captain | Merchant Prince |

**Coin Troops: The "Free" Upgrades**
Coin troops have `auto_draw`—their draw effect resolves at turn start,
before you choose draw order. This means:
- They draw to replace themselves (deck-size neutral)
- They add a small bonus (+1 combat, +1 trade) to hands they appear in
- They don't slow your shuffle velocity

**Deck Economics:**
Unlike normal cards that bloat your deck, Coin Troops are "free" in the
sense that they don't cost you shuffle velocity. You'll still see your
power cards at the same rate. The bonus just appears on hands where the
troop shows up.

**Forecast: Trading in Certainty**
High-level Merchant bases reveal your actual hand size for next turn.
Not which cards—just the count. This lets you plan with confidence:
"7 cards next turn means I can spend aggressively this turn."

**Play Pattern:**
Early game: Acquire Coin Mint, build infrastructure
Mid game: Accumulate coin, spend on troops when allies available
Late game: Deck full of "free" bonuses, forecast enables perfect planning

## High Kingdom: The Logisticians

**Philosophy:** Victory through discipline and consistency.

**Core Mechanic: Recruit (The March Column)**
Send a card from hand to the bottom of your deck, then draw from the top.
Thematically, you're sending a soldier to the back of the endless 2x2 mile
march column to gather reinforcements. They'll catch up when the column
cycles (deck reshuffles).

**Deck Economics:**
The recruit mechanic has a floor and a ceiling:

*Floor (worst case):* Scout → Scout
- You've cycled through a bad card faster
- Increased deck velocity
- More shuffles per game = more plays of power cards

*Ceiling (best case):* Scout → Knight Commander
- Immediate upgrade in hand quality
- Plus the velocity benefit

**The Key Insight:**
Even when recruit doesn't upgrade your hand, it accelerates your deck.
More shuffles per game means more total plays of your best cards across
the entire game. Kingdom wins through cumulative advantage.

**Ploughshares to Ploughs:**
When soldiers choose peace, they're building. When peaceful folk choose
soldiery, they intend to capitalize on it. The recruited card isn't
"buried"—it's sent to gather reinforcements.

**Play Pattern:**
Early game: Recruit away starting cards, seek velocity
Mid game: Build authority buffer, recruit situational cards
Late game: High-velocity deck cycles power cards repeatedly

## The Wilds: The Pack

**Philosophy:** Gather strength, then overwhelm with brutal power.

**Core Mechanic: Frontier & Charge**
Wilds cards can be played to the Frontier instead of the play area:
- Card's cost adds to base defense
- Ally effects trigger immediately (healing/resources)
- Main effects (combat/draw) are held back

When a Frontier Leader is played, all frontier cards charge into play
simultaneously, triggering all their main effects at once.

**Effect Split:**
Wilds cards divide their effects:
- Main effects: Combat and draw only (offensive)
- Ally effects: Trade and authority only (defensive/resources)

This creates tension: play normally for immediate damage, or bank cards
for a devastating charge turn.

**The Vulnerable Buildup:**
While the pack gathers at the frontier:
- Base defense increases (cards add their cost)
- Ally effects trigger each turn (sustained healing)
- But the cards aren't dealing damage yet
- Other players can see the threat building
- Attacking the base sends frontier cards to discard

**Contestable Power:**
The Wilds' strength is visible. Other players can:
- Attack bases to disrupt the buildup
- Race to kill before the charge happens
- Build counter-positions

This creates interactive gameplay—the Wilds player must judge when to
charge versus when to keep building.

**Pack Scaling (n² Growth):**
Wilds ally effects trigger per OTHER ally in play:
- 1 ally: effects trigger once
- 2 allies: effects trigger twice each (4 total)
- 3 allies: effects trigger three times each (9 total)

This rewards commitment to the faction.

**Play Pattern:**
Early game: Acquire bases, establish frontier positions
Mid game: Stack cards at frontier, heal while building
Late game: Time the charge for maximum impact

## Faction Interactions

**Artificer vs Wilds:**
Artificers want long games to compound upgrades. Wilds want to end games
with overwhelming charges. The Artificer must thin fast enough to find
answers; the Wilds must charge before the Artificer's deck becomes too
efficient.

**Merchant vs Kingdom:**
Both play for consistency, but differently. Merchants build infrastructure
and harvest compound returns. Kingdom optimizes velocity and cycle speed.
Merchants are vulnerable early (need Coin Mint); Kingdom is steady throughout.

**Kingdom vs Wilds:**
Kingdom's recruit mechanic is steady and uncontestable—no one can stop you
from cycling cards. Wilds' frontier is powerful but visible and attackable.
Kingdom grinds; Wilds spikes.

**Artificer vs Merchant:**
Both invest for compound returns. Artificers invest by removal (scrap),
Merchants by addition (coin troops). Artificers have nothing to lose once
established; Merchants need ongoing infrastructure.

## Design Principles

**Each Faction Has:**
1. A unique relationship with tempo
2. A core mechanic that defines play pattern
3. Clear strengths and weaknesses
4. Interactive elements (can be contested or countered)

**Deck Quality Paths:**
| Method | Effect on Deck | Velocity Impact |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Scrap (Artificer) | Shrinks | Faster |
| Coin Troops (Merchant) | Neutral | Unchanged |
| Recruit (Kingdom) | Neutral | Faster (cycling) |
| Frontier (Wilds) | Neutral | Burst (delayed) |

**No Dominant Strategy:**
Each path has trade-offs. Scrap is permanent. Coin requires infrastructure.
Recruit has variance. Frontier is contestable. The best strategy depends on
the game state and opponent choices.
