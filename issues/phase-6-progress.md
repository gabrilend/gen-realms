## Completed: 0/14

## Technology Stack
- ComfyUI API for Stable Diffusion
- Client-side image generation (browser gets SD endpoint from server)
- Progressive inpainting for battle scenes

## Notes
Phase 6 brings the visual magic with dynamically generated card art that regenerates each time a card is drawn. The browser client makes image generation requests using the style guide from localStorage. Battle scenes build up through progressive inpainting.
