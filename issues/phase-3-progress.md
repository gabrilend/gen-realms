## Completed: 0/10

## Technology Stack
- ncurses for terminal UI
- HTML5 Canvas for browser rendering
- localStorage for client preferences
- JavaScript for browser interactivity

## Notes
Phase 3 provides the visual layer for both client types. Terminal clients connect via SSH and use ncurses for display. Browser clients load WebAssembly and render to canvas with JavaScript animations.
